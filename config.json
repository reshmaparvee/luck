From the past 9 years I have been working to construct theory of Gravity according to the rules of Quantum Mechanics. Unification of Gravity with other forces , quantum computing, and new approach to Dark matter and Dark energy are my interests. The articles uploaded here are the ways I approached to construct Gravity according to the Quantum rules. currently my final results are under review. I have possessed with TIME!",
